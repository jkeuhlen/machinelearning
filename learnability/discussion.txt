argue about an ordering of hypothesis classes in terms of complexity: hyperplanes through the origin, arbitrary hyperplanes, and axis-aligned rectangles (you can use your experiments as a guide, but simply reporting those numbers is not sufficient; you must make a mathematical argument)

prove that your frequency correctly classifies any training set (up to floating point precision on the computer).

Suppose we are classifying real numbers, not integers. The classifier returns positive (1) if the point is greater than the sin function and negative (0) otherwise.
Classification Rule

Give an example of four points that cannot be shattered by this classifier. How does this relate to the VC dimension?
